# Machine Learning Classification Project

This project is a machine learning classification pipeline built using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and Pandas. It explores and compares multiple classification algorithms on a dataset loaded from a compressed CSV file.

## Overview

The notebook implements the following key steps:

- Coding Environment  
    - Importing the Libraries  
    - Loading the Dataset  
- Initial Data Exploration  
- Data Cleaning  
    - Removing Duplicates  
    - Filling in Missing Values  
- Data Analysis  
    - Detecting Outliers  
    - Exploring Correlations between Features  
    - Feature Selection  
    - Balancing the Dataset  
- Training the Models  
    - Encoding Qualitative Data  
    - Model Assessment  
        - Decision Trees  
        - Random Forests  
        - Categorical Naive Bayes  
        - Logistic Regression  
        - K-Nearest Neighbors  
        - Support Vector Machines  
        - Extreme Gradient Boosting  
- Conclusion  
    - Results and Analysis
    - Future Works

## Requirements

Install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run
Please open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook (or in any IDE of your choice) and run the cells. All compilation instructions and comments on the project's development are included in the notebook."
